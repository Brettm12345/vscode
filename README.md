# VSCode Config

> The ultimate VSCode configuration. Made with love and funtional programming :heart:

I put a lot of effort into building this. My goal was to make a configuration akin to doom/spaceemacs in typescript using the [init-script](https://github.com/bodil/vscode-init-script) plugin.

## Todo

- [x] Generate types for configuration [see](https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript) **Almost complete:** *need to add scope handling*
- [x] Setup custom keymaps for packages
- [x] Conditional loading
- [ ] Defer packages by priority? (This might work already. Must test)
- [ ] Add screenshots to readme

## Credits
