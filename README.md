# VSCode Config

I put a lot of effort into building this. My goal was to make a configuration akin to doom/spaceemacs in typescript using the [init-script](https://github.com/bodil/vscode-init-script) plugin.

## Todo

- [-] Generate types for installed extensions [see](https://github.com/bcherny/json-schema-to-typescript)
- [x] Setup custom keymaps for packages
- [x] Conditional loading
- [ ] Defer packages by priority? (This might work already. Must test)

> Special thanks to [vscode-use-package](https://github.com/bodil/vscode-use-package)
